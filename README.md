About Astro: 
Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.
Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Project Commands
All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

7.) Save your files and run `npm start dev` to run the project.
8.) You can check this page by going to the name of the folder you set under the pages/ folder.

## To create a new license page
1.) Go under the new folder you made for the article page and create new folder again with the url name you want.

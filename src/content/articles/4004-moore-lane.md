  text: ["4004 Moore Lane is an open-source USD asset, the purpose of which is to provide a fully composed, high-quality scene for the purpose of testing various visual computing issues. The house itself was wrapped around a number of typical problem areas for light transport and noise sampling. Thin openings in exterior walls, recessed area light sources, deeply shadowed corners, and high-frequency details are all “stops” on the tour of issues around the house interior. The exterior landscape surrounding the house consisted of a relatively simple ecosystem of instanced plants which could provide some additional levels of complexity. In addition to the geometry itself being designed to exacerbate some typical issues, the USD structure itself was created for several layers of testing.",],
